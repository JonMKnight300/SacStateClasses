Lessons Learned: The documentation for this class was a beast. 
Assignment 1 was 14 pages, and then by the time Assignment 3 came
along, it was 9 pages. I took time at the beginning of each 
assignments to intepret the often not very clear documentation, 
break down a list of requirements, and figure out the best order
in which to implement each. These projects also built on each 
other, meaning the final Assignment is the culmination.

Ineffeciencies: We were using something called Codename One, an 
extremely limited game engine. Having pripr experience with
Unity, this felt like a major step backward. Still, I gave it
my all and delivered on each Assignment. I reinforced concepts
for game design that felt a little rusty at that point, which
was a bonus. 

Missing: Sound files are missing, because a lot of them are not available
for releases outside of their sources or for private/student use.
