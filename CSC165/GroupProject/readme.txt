Lessons Learned: Due to a number of issues, I took a step back from
most of the coding on this group project (especially a key bug in
the student designed game engine we had to use for the class that made 
it impossible for me to work with the code after a certain point, more 
on that under ineffeciencies). I instead focused on other areas to
be of use, primarily designing all of the object files and animation 
in Blender. I still worked hard to understand the concepts of the 
engine, that I could apply to a more standard modern engine. 

I did work on some small bits of code, such as the tesselation feature
and one or two other smaller features. 

Ineffeciencies: The bug made the game crash on my system (and 
apparently on one of the teacher's computers as well, and at 
a couple other students in the class), whenever animations were
in the game itself. So while I could freely design and create
the animations required for the game, once the animations were
in the game, that made it very difficult to test the game on my
end. We were also during a pandemic, so coming to campus to work
wasn't realy an option at the time.
