Lessons Learned: With the tools of the class, I was able to mess around with and learn about a lot of 
underlining techniques used in many modern day game engines, giving me a better understanding with how 
they work. This insight will serve me as I continue developing games with engines like Unity. 

Ineffeciencies: The organization of the main file is not what it should be. Massive projects should always be 
approached with organization first and this is why. It becomes too cumbersome at the end to go back and fix
everything. Future projects I aim to approach with an organization first approach, as I go, to keep things
manageable. 

Missing: I left out the Object Model files and the corresponding Textures, because some of these files are 
ones I plan to use in future projects and don't want them freely available to download at this time. You
can see what objects I created in the corresponding Readme file.
