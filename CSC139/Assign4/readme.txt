To Compile: 
Go to folder, type javac *.java

To Run:
Go to folder, type java Starter

To bring in files and set up output, change the INPUT_FILE_NAME and OUTPUT_FILE_NAME String variables. 

For Optimal, INFINITY is represented by the number, 666

Lessons Learned: With this assignment, I was able to develop a deeper understanding of how Replacement Policies
work in operating systems, such as FIFO, Optimal, and LRU. 

Ineffeciencies: Ideally, a more adaptable array system should be implemented. My version will give errors if the 
100 test limit is surpassed. In the past, I have implemented data structures such as a Linked List with CSC 430 
at SacramentoCity College, that would better serve this assignment.
